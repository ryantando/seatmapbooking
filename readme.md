## React Native Seat Map Booking Layout

To run on your device (make sure you have installed android sdk on your machine) 

```sh
$ npm install
```
Or

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Then

```sh
$ react-native run-android
```
I only tested on android but if you wanted to test on ios, run with
```sh
$ react-native run-ios
```
